# Progress Bar

This simple C++ terminal program displays a progress bar representing how much time has progressed.

## Instructions

1. Edit "int start" and "int end" to your desired start and end time (UTC).
2. Run the program in a terminal.

## Known Bugs

- Time segments that pass over midnight UTC do not work properly, I may come back and fix this eventually but this code is mainly just for my personal use, which does not involve long segments/segments crossing midnight UTC.
